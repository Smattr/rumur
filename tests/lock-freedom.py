"""
Test that a compiled verifier does not depend on libatomic.

Uses of __atomic built-ins and C11 atomics can sometimes cause the compiler to
emit calls to libatomic instead of inline instructions. This is a problem
because we use these in the verifier to implement lock-free algorithms, while
the libatomic implementations take locks, defeating the purpose of using them.
This test checks that we end up with no libatomic calls in the compiled
verifier.
